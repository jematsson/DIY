# DIY

This repository contains my current works in the area of do-it-yourself. As I track here my DIY projects containing code, they will be of random interest to you dear reader, but feel free to take any inspiration, and send me feedback (use [issues](https://github.com/pbauermeister/DIY/issues)).

Please browse from here into the sub-directories, which contain summaries as README files.
